# DataAnalysis
## Analysis of relationship between housework and arthritis in elderly people using the NLSAA longitudinal study
### Youngjin Noh

### Abstract
The purpose of the study is to reveal how household labour affects arthritis. Although a number of studies analysed the causes of arthritis, this study focused on household labour. Hence, the study selected Arthritis or rheumatism and Night pain or morning joint stiffness as dependent variables and Who does the housework, three types of housework and general variables as independent variables in NLSAA. The study used Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, Chi-square test, and Logistic regression through SPSS. The study also concluded that women have a significant relationship to arthritis.

### Part 1 Introduction 
Arthritis occurs mainly in the elderly, and female patients account for a large proportion (Semanik et al., 2004). Also, a number of women are reported to be disabled by arthritis in their old age (Sherrer et al., 1986). However, it could be possible to prevent various arthritis by exercising, improving lifestyles and diet (Deane, 2018; Forsyth et al., 2018; Perlman et al., 1990) but 70 percent of senior citizens do not exercise regularly, and 60 percent do not walk more than a mere mile in a year (Kovar et al., 1992). Furthermore, the contribution of husband to household chores decreases sharply in old age regardless of his spouse's income or working hours, significantly increasing the number of working hours for elderly women (Grunow et al., 2012). Therefore, a number of elderly people tend to do more housework without spending much time exercising, raising the risk of arthritis (Semanik et al., 2004). The study focuses on the relationship between arthritis and household labour. Moreover, the relationship between housework and arthritis could be associated with many other disease studies and could be an important key to preventing arthritis.

The justification for this study is to present the relationships derived from the analysis of data from arthritis and household labour. It could also help emphasize the importance of preventing arthritis. This study uses IBM SPSS Statistics Version 25 with the NLSAA longitudinal study.

### Part 2 Literature review 
Arthritis is a very common disease in older people. A number of patients even consider arthritis an incurable disease and give up treatment (Sherrer et al., 1986). However, several recent papers have reported improved arthritis among elderly patients (Perlman et al., 1990; Deane, 2018). For example, old patients with arthritis performed cardio such as aerobic exercise for muscle strengthening and flexibility. After 16 weeks, their pain eased, and their joint function improved (Perlman et al., 1990). In addition, Deane (2018) claimed that although further research is still needed, arthritis, which is believed to be incurable, would be treatable once proper treatment is received. However, a number of elderly female people at risk for arthritis are worsening it by household labour, let alone treatment. For instance, the surveyed elderly women with arthritis performed an average of 47 different activities, including high-intensity activities, of which housework accounted for 67 percent. However, leisure activities and regular exercise were only 15 percent and 10 percent, respectively (Semanik et al., 2004). It has even been reported that older women with arthritis do more physical activity such as labour (Heesch & Brown, 2008). What is more unfortunate is that they participate in more labour than they did in their youth. Their working hours increased, and their exercise and relaxation time decreased with age (Grunow et al., 2012; Kovar et al., 1992).

### Part 3 Research aim and objectives
The purpose of this study is to analyse the relationship between household labour and arthritis to present practical prevention methods for arthritis. A number of studies in the above literature review suggest treating arthritis with exercise and drugs. However, this text focuses on housework, highlighting the need for more research into the two relationships. This range focuses on the NLSAA longitudinal study.

#### A)	Research question:
 1)	What is the relationship between household labour and arthritis?
#### B)	Objectives: Analyse the data through SPSS 

This study has three benefits. First, the study could make us speculate on the relationship between household labour and arthritis. Second, part of the data analysis could be understood through this study. Third, in this study, we may understand the labour of older women and the environment they are in.

### Part 4 Methodology
As indicated by the introduction, literature review and research aim and objective above, research with SPSS on the relationship between household labour and arthritis may be important and might help to understand household labour of old women and prevent arthritis. Therefore, the study may answer the following questions.

•	What is the relationship between household labour and arthritis?

#### Research Design
The philosophy used in this study is pragmatism, which focuses on practical effects and the use of tools. In addition, the method of longitudinal inductive is used in this study because general principles are established first and then analysed later (Saunders, Lewis & Thornhill, 2009).

#### Brief description of the NLSAA study and its data
The study extracted and used data from the Nottingham Longitude Study of Activity and Ageing (NLSAA) to identify the relationship between household labour and arthritis. The NLSAA is a randomized study of 1024 Nottingham residents aged 65 or older, consisting of a simple assessment of physical activity level, handle strength, weight, shoulder flexibility, depression, social participation, life satisfaction and so on (Morgan, 1998). The study was conducted using data from 1985 - the first survey year of the NLSAA. The relevant sampling method was used in consideration of validity and accessibility. The relevant sampling method refers to sampling from accessible populations that conform to the criteria of the study (Duff, 2008).

#### Description of used variables, analyses and procedures
The study first selected arthritis or rheumatoid and night pain or morning joint stiffness which is a typical symptom of arthritis as dependent variables (Semanik et al., 2004; Sherrer et al., 1986; Perlman et al., 1990). The reason why Night pain or morning joint stiffness was selected and set as a dependent variable is that the respondent might respond that there is no arthritis in situations where they do not know if they have arthritis. In addition, some data have been selected for independent variables, which can be classified into two types. One of the two independent variables is the general variable, which includes age, sex and who does the house work? The other contains three variables depending on the degree of the housework.

This study would perform a descriptive statistics analyses on every variable extracted and execute a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test to determine the normal distribution of continuous variables. Also, Chi-square test will be used on categorial variables, and logistic will be applied to binary dependent variables as inferential statistical test to analyse a relationship each other (Daya, 2001; Asar & Genç, 2017).   

#### Presentation, description and summary the data
A table and a graph of all the characteristics of the variables used in the study are shown in the Appendix A. Table 2 below shows the characteristics of the variables.

![Figure2](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/5.PNG?raw=true)

#### Normality test of continuous variables
Histogram of age, heavy housework, moderate housework and light housework can be found in Appendix B and their distribution are skewed. Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was applied to verify that the four continuous variables follow a normal distribution (Massey, 1951). As a result of test, the null hypothesis is that the four distributions are normal.

![Figure3](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/6.PNG?raw=true)

The results in Table 3 above indicate that the four continuous variables are not normally distributed.

#### Inferential statistics
##### 1.	Chi² Test
Since arthritis or rheumatism, night pain or morning joint stiffness, age, and who does the housework are nominal data, use the Chi-square test to find out their relationship (Agresti, 2013).

Table 3. The result of crosstabulation for gender

![Figure4](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/1.PNG?raw=true)

188 male respondents said they had arthritis, while 432 females said they had arthritis.

![Figure5](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/7.PNG?raw=true)

As shown in the table above, 248 respondents who do household chores by themselves, 47 have spouses, 11 have family members, 25 have outsiders, 43 have volunteers/stat workers and 242 shares.

![Figure6](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/8.PNG?raw=true)

The above results indicate that there is a difference in rates between groups. Also, Chi-square tests can be used to estimate that there is a significant relationship between arthritis and independent categorial variables.

![Figure7](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/9.PNG?raw=true)

It is worth mentioning that the risk of arthritis among older women is 2.484, which means that women are 2.484 times more likely to develop arthritis than men. (95% CI=1.918-3.215) Detailed Chi Square test could be checked in the appendix C.

![Figure8](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/10.PNG?raw=true)

163 male respondents said that they feel night pain or morning joint stiffness, while 339 females said that they feel pain

![Figure9](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/11.PNG?raw=true)
![Figure10](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/12.PNG?raw=true)

As shown in the table above, 187 respondents who do household chores by themselves, 48 have spouses, 7 have family members, 21 have outsiders, 36 have volunteers/stat workers and 202 shares.

![Figure11](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/13.PNG?raw=true)

The above results indicate that there is a difference in rates between groups. Also, Chi-square tests can be used to estimate that there is a significant relationship between night pain or morning stiffness and independent categorial variables.

![Figure12](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/14.PNG?raw=true)

It is worth mentioning that the risk of night pain or morning stiffness among older women is 1.715, which means that women are 1.175 times more likely to experience night pain or morning stiffness than men. (95% CI=1.330-2.212) Detailed Chi Square test could be checked in the appendix.

##### 2.	Logistic Regression
Output of linear regression is continuous but logistic regression output is categorized. However, it could be used linear regression for binary classification but there are some difficulties. Since, Arthritis or rheumatism and Night pain or morning joint stiffness are binary data, logistic regression is appropriate to identify relationships with independent variables (Asar & Genç, 2017). 

H˚ = Arthritis or rheumatism or Night pain or morning joint stiffness have nothing to do with independent variables.

Table 11. The result of logistic regression

![Figure13](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/2.PNG?raw=true)
![Figure14](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/2-2.PNG?raw=true)
![Figure15](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/2-3.PNG?raw=true)

In respect to Table 11, only the p value of gender is less than 0.001 rejecting H˚. Hence, gender is significant for arthritis or rheumatism and as one could see from the Odds ratio, male decrease 0.392 times risk than female with arthritis or rheumatism. However, “who does the housework”, Heavy housework, moderate housework and light housework are not significant for “arthritis or rheumatism and this study cannot conclude that they affect arthritis or rheumatism.

Table 12. The result of logistic regression 2

![Figure16](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/3.PNG?raw=true)
![Figure17](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/3-2.PNG?raw=true)
![Figure18](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/3-3.PNG?raw=true)
![Figure19](https://github.com/myaqueenas/DataAnalysis/blob/main/Figure/3-4,5.PNG?raw=true)

In respect to Table 12, only the p value of gender is less than 0.001 rejecting H˚. Hence, gender is significant for Night pain or morning joint stiffness and as one could see from the Odds ratio, male decrease 0.506 times risk than female with Night pain or morning joint stiffness. However, “who does the housework”, Heavy housework, moderate housework and light housework are not significant for Night pain or morning joint stiffness and this study cannot conclude that they affect Night pain or morning joint stiffness.

### Part 5 Results
The purpose of this study is to identify the relationship between household labour and arthritis. The variables the study extract and used are Arthritis or rheumatism? (ar_rh_85), Night pain or morning joint stiffness (arthp_85), Age at 85 interview (x_age_85), Sex of Respondent (sex_85), Who does the housework? (hswrk_85), Heavy housework (mins\week) (hact1_85), Moderate housework (mins/week) (hact2_85) and Light housework (mins\week) (hact3_85). The reason why Night pain or morning joint stiffness (arthp_85) was selected and set as a dependent variable is that the respondent might respond that there is no arthritis in situations where they do not know if they have arthritis. According to the result of Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test, continuous variables (Age, Heavy housework, Moderate housework and Light housework) in used variables are not normally distributed. Furthermore, as Arthritis or rheumatism, Night pain or morning joint stiffness, age and Who does the housework are nominal data, the study examined their relationship with a Chi-square test. As a result of Chi-square, it was possible to estimate that there was a significant relationship between the arthritic, pain and independent conclusion variables. Moreover, one of the highlights of these results is that women are more involved in arthritis or pain than men. Linear regression may be used for binary classification, but there may be some problems, so logistic regression was used in this study (Asar & Genc, 2017). The results showed that although arthritis could be related to sex, it is difficult to say that it is related to who does the housework or the three types of housework. The test also analysed the Night pain or morning joint stiffness could be related to sex, but it does not relate to who does housework or to three types of family.

#### Potential Significance
Although the results were unexpectedly stated that arthritis only affects the sex, it could deliberately reduce household labour after a patient with arthritis has a disease. In this case, arthritis caused by household labour will no longer allow her to do household chores, so her spouse or household members will take over the housework. Therefore, the time spent on the housework of patients would have decreased. People with arthritis would say they do not do housework. However, as a result of the study, women are more vulnerable to arthritis than men.

### Part 6 Discussion
#### a)	In relation to other studies
A number of studies have focused more on arthritis in women than on men (Heesch & Brown, 2008; Semanik et al., 2004; Deane, 2018). This study also focused on housekeeping, while other papers focused on the effects of various arthritis (Deane, 2018; Forsyth et al., 2018; Perlman et al., 1990; Semanik et al., 2004; Sherrer et al., 1986). Also, most of the research mentioned above on arthritis is medical research and papers.
#### b)	Limitations of the study
The size of arthritis data in one particular region of the NLSAA may be small. A large number of data is required for research that lacks medical theory and knowledge (Malterud, 2016). In addition, household labour data before the onset of arthritis may be needed rather than current household labour data to establish the relationship between arthritis and household labour. Arthritis is also not only caused by housework, so data on their usual sleeping posture or eating habits may be needed (Deane, 2018). Finally, there is uncertainty because there are missing values.
#### c)	Suggestions for further analyses
In this study, the results of the Chi-Square test were different from those of the logistic regression. Suggest that future studies use more independent variables to demonstrate the relationship and suggest larger-sized data than data limited to NLSAA. It also suggests that the medical background and knowledge of arthritis could be a deep study.

### Part 7 Conclusion
Arthritis usually occurs in older women (Semanik et al., 2004). However, the burden on household labour by elderly women does not decrease even in modern times, hurting their health (Grunow et al., 2012; Semanik et al., 2004). The study focused on the relationship between arthritis and household labour in hopes of helping prevent arthritis in elderly women. The conclusion showed that there was a clear link between women and arthritis, but the relationship with household labour was unclear. However, arthritis caused by housework may sometimes lead to her spouse or family member taking over as she no longer has the ability to do housework. In addition, there is a significant relationship between women and arthritis as a result of this study, and it could be further study and support the claims of Semanik et al. (2004).
